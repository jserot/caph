This directory contains examples of CAPH programs, stored in distinct subdirectories to facilitate navigation.

To run an example :
- add the caph bin directory to your PATH. Ex (for bash) : "PATH=<prefix>/bin:$PATH; export PATH"  (where <prefix>
  is the path passed to the configure script when installing) 
- cd to the example directory (ex: "cd basic/scale")
- build makefiles: "caphmake <prefix>"  (where, again, <prefix> is the path passed to the configure script when installing) 
- "make dot.show" for viewing the graph representation (using the .dot viewer passed to the configure script)
- "make sim.run" for running the simulator representation
- "make systemc.run" for generating SystemC code, compiling and running it
- "make vhdl.run" for generating VHDL code, compiling and running it
